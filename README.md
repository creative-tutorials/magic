# Magic

Magic is a webstore for developers who want to showcase what they've built to the public without worrying about upvotes and reviews. In simple words, just host it and share it.

## Magic to the developer

- Step1: To use `magic` you must first have an account with `magic` so this means you will need to sign up or login to your account.
- Step2: Once you are done creating your account, simply hit that request link, fill out the form with the appropriate information and you're done. It takes up to 24 hours for your request to be processed.
- Step3: Once your request has been processed, you will receive an email that your request for `app-name` has been accepted.
- Step4: All that is left now is go view your app and share it with the world.
