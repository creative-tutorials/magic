# Magic

Magic is a webstore for anyone who wants to share a web-application to the public without worrying about upvotes and reviews. In simple words, just host it and share it.

## Magic to the developer

- Step1: To use `magic` you must first have an account with `magic` so this means you will need to sign up or login to your account.
- Step2: Once you are done creating your account, simply hit that request link, fill out the form with the **appropriate information** and you're done. It takes up to a minute or an hour for your request to be processed.
- Step3: Once your request has been approved, the app which you requested will now be available.
